Else we are going to find your home and use your phone to break up with your roblox gf. [Pozdrawiamy pana GF'a! (tutaj gf było w znaczeniu girlfriend)] Wow! we're gonna be remembered!!! Let's rap for Jesus!  : Well I wrote this song for the Christian youth
I wanna teach kids the Christian truth
If you wanna reach those kids on the street
Then you gotta do a rap to a hip-hop beat
I gave my sermon an urban kick
My rhymes are fly, my beats are sick
My crew is big and it keeps getting bigger
That's cause Jesus Christ is my nigga</marquee>
